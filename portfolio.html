      About projects and interests
      <br>
      I don't have that much experience of coding or making web pages, still beginner. Just this and some other course i've been taking to learn.<br>
      But here's something i'd like to try to build in the future;
      actual working web page for shop or band etc.,
      countdown / alarm clock etc.,
      somekind of game, maybe something like Rock, paper, scissors, text adventure or word / number guessing game, quiz.. i don't know yet.<br>
      My other interests and hobbies are knitting, crocheting, reading and videogames.
