      About projects and interests
      <br>
      I don't have that much experience of coding or making web pages. Just this and some other course i've been taking to learn.
      But here's something i'd like to try to build in the future;
      Web page for shop or band etc.,
      Countdown clock etc.,
      Somekind of game, maybe something like Rock, paper, scissors or word guessing game.. i don't know yet.
