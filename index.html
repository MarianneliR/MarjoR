  <p>Hello, I'm Marjo. I have vocational qualification in business and administration (orientation in economics and office) but unfortunately haven't got job from that
    field so decided to try learning something new and choose a web development course because i've been interested in working at computer and would like to know how
    web pages etc. works.
